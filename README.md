# Demand Curve Analysis & Optimal Pricing

This project analyzes the relationship between price and quantity sold to determine the optimal price that maximizes revenue. It uses both SQL queries and regression modeling to compare approaches, and discusses economic concepts such as Giffen and Veblen goods.

## Features

- SQL-based analysis for calculating revenue and finding optimal price points
- Linear regression to estimate the demand curve
- Comparison of model-based and naive approaches to revenue maximization
- Discussion of economic exceptions and possible extensions to profit optimization

## Files

- `notebook.ipynb` — Main Jupyter notebook with SQL and Python code, analysis, and explanations
- `demand_curve_data.csv` — Dataset used for analysis

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or a compatible environment.
3. Ensure `demand_curve_data.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.
4. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis.

## Requirements

- Jupyter Notebook
- SQL support (e.g., via Jupyter SQL extensions or an environment like DataLab)
- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, plotly (or other libraries as used in the notebook)
